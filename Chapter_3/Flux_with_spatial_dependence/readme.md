Scripts for running the examples in § 3.3 and 3.4 (advection equation with a space-dependent flux function in conservative or nonconservative form).  

1. Nonconservative form: solution using Pyclaw (see § 3.3).
2. Conservative form (see § 3.4): solution using classic Clawpack (see § 3.4).
3. Alternative: handling the conservative case as a nonconservative equation with a source term (see § 3.4.5).
